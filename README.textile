h1. Mail Logger

Braindead-simple email logger for ActionMailer using ActiveRecord

h2. Gem Installation for Rails 2.1+

In config/environment.rb:

    config.gem "fusionary-mail_logger",
      :lib     => "mail_logger",
      :source  => "http://gems.github.com"

h2. Generator

Ensure the environment's database is present and then run

    script/generate mail_logger

This will generate the migration and generate the MailLog ActiveRecord model.

The model includes a module that attaches all the necessary code, allowing you to add other code (named scopes, etc) without interference

h2. Ultra-Transparent

You could install this gem and not notice *anything* different with your application.  It sits in the background, dumping all emails that get sent to your database.  The to, from, and subject line, as well as created_at, are all indexed for your querying pleasure.  Set up named scopes to search fields, or aggregate all common subjects and allow administrator accounts to filter/view them.  Whatever the case, the data is yours; whipping together the controller and setting permissions is the easy part.

h2. About

The purpose of this is to provide a simple audit trail, specific to ActionMailer, for Rails apps.  Without much work, you could write a controller and some views and then monitor the emails sent out; that's really beyond the scope of this project though.
